# Student Management System (Java)

## 📌 Overview

The **Student Management System** is a console-based Java application that allows users to manage student information and their academic records. It provides features to add students, store yearly CGPA details, search students by ID, and display all student records.

This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and collections (`ArrayList`).

---

## 🛠️ Features

* Add student details (ID, Name, Age, Branch)
* Add academic records (Year-wise CGPA)
* Search student by ID
* Display all students and their academic records
* Menu-driven user interface
* Data stored dynamically using `ArrayList`

---

## 🧱 Technologies Used

* **Language:** Java
* **Concepts:** OOP, Classes & Objects, ArrayList, Scanner
* **IDE:** Any Java-supported IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code, etc.)
